        <p><span>1.</span> "It's OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket."</p>
        <p><span>2.</span> "If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic-being able to talk to people
        over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things
        that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago."</p>
        <p><span>3.</span> "Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up."</p>
        <p><span>4.</span> "If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it's not."</p>
        <p><span>5.</span> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."</p>
